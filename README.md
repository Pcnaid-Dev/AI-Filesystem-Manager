AI-Filesystem-Manager

This repository contains all the high-level requirements and implementation instructions for building a local/offline AI-powered file management application, leveraging GPU acceleration and a web-based UI. The AI (or any developer) should follow these steps:
	1.	Read the Core Documentation
	•	Comprehensive_Instruction.md:
	•	This file outlines the entire blueprint of the application, including pluggable AI models, indexing strategies, scheduling, and user interaction flow.
	•	Application_Functionality.md:
	•	Specifies core and advanced features (OCR, face recognition, object tagging, vector-based search, etc.).
	•	Core_Tools_and_Libraries.md:
	•	Lists recommended open-source tools, libraries, and models (e.g., Tesseract, YOLOv8, LLMs) to fulfill each feature.
	•	High_Level_Workflow.md:
	•	Summarizes the step-by-step pipeline (file watcher → metadata extraction → duplication checks → AI tagging → search/storage).
	•	Resource_Links.md:
	•	Provides direct URLs to source code, model checkpoints, and official documentation for quick setup.
	2.	Assemble the Code
	•	After reviewing these files, the AI (or developer) should generate or craft the application code—preferably in Python—following the instructions provided.
	•	The final output should include:
	1.	A file scanning/watching mechanism
	2.	A pipeline for metadata extraction (Tika, ExifTool, FFmpeg)
	3.	OCR (Tesseract/PaddleOCR) and AI-based indexing (object detection, face recognition, LLM-driven text classification)
	4.	Duplicate detection (hash-based + near-duplicate for images)
	5.	Search integration (ElasticSearch + Faiss/Chroma)
	6.	A web UI (e.g., Gradio or FastAPI + front-end) for user interaction
	7.	GPU acceleration references for heavy tasks
	3.	Validate & Iterate
	•	Ensure all components (OCR, face recognition, LLM-based summarization, etc.) are properly integrated.
	•	Confirm the entire pipeline runs smoothly on a Linux environment with an NVIDIA GPU (e.g., WSL2).
	•	Provide any environment setup details and scripts needed for others to replicate the build.
	4.	Ask for Clarifications
	•	If any file or feature is unclear, the AI (or user) should request additional details before finalizing the application.

Purpose
This project aims to streamline file organization, apply intelligent tagging and summarization, and enable advanced search capabilities—all running locally and privately. The instructions within each .md file guide the AI or developer in creating the final application.

Feel free to customize or extend this to fit your specific environment, usage, or project layout.
