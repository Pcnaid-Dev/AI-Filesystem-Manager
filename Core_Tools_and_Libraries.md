 Core Tools & Libraries 
 
 	1.	Duplicate File Checker (General)
	•	Built-in Hashing (Python’s hashlib): Compute SHA-256 or MD5 for exact duplicates.
	•	dupeGuru (Python/Qt) or pydupe (unofficial): More feature-complete deduplication.
	•	imagededup: Specialized library for near-duplicate image detection.
	2.	Media/Document Parsing & Metadata Extraction
	•	Apache Tika (Java-based)
	•	Extract text & metadata from PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, ePub, HTML, etc.
	•	ExifTool (Perl-based)
	•	Extract EXIF, IPTC, XMP metadata from images, videos, audio.
	•	FFmpeg / FFprobe
	•	Parse media container metadata (duration, resolution) and optionally extract frames or audio streams.
	•	Optional Additional Libraries: MuPDF, LibRaw, Libarchive, etc., for specialized formats.
	3.	OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
	•	Tesseract (C++ engine; Python wrapper: pytesseract)
	•	Widely used, good accuracy for printed text.
	•	PaddleOCR (Python)
	•	Lightweight detection + recognition, good multilingual support.
	•	Configurable swappability if you want to toggle between engines.
	4.	Object Detection & Image Tagging
	•	YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
	•	For object detection in images or extracted video frames; pick Nano/Small variants for speed or bigger models for accuracy.
	•	Runs well on GPU with CUDA.
	5.	Face Recognition
	•	InsightFace (Python)
	•	Face detection, embedding, clustering, recognition.
	•	Alternatively, YOLO-based face detection or RetinaFace if you need different approaches.
	6.	Vector Database for Embeddings
	•	Faiss (C++/Python) or Chroma (Python)
	•	Store embeddings from text, images, or faces for similarity search.
	•	Both can handle GPU acceleration if needed (Faiss has a GPU version, Chroma uses CPU but can integrate ANN backends).
	7.	Text Embeddings & Semantic Search
	•	Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
	•	Fast, high-quality text embeddings.
	•	OpenCLIP (ViT-B/32 or ViT-L/14)
	•	For generating image embeddings (also supports text → embedding alignment).
	8.	LLMs (Summarization, Classification, Chat)
	•	Mistral-7B or Phi-2 (2.7B)
	•	Local text generation, summarization, classification (GPU recommended).
	•	TinyLlama-1.1B
	•	Very lightweight, minimal GPU usage.
	•	FLAN-T5 Large
	•	Encoder–decoder for summarizing or short text generation.
	•	Pick the size best suited to your GPU memory. Smaller models generally run faster on lower VRAM.
	9.	Search & Indexing
	•	ElasticSearch or OpenSearch
	•	Traditional text/metadata indexing, keyword-based retrieval.
	•	Combine with a vector database (Faiss/Chroma) for hybrid search (keyword + semantic).
	10.	Scheduler/Watcher

	•	Python’s watchdog (for real-time folder monitoring).
	•	For scheduled scans (e.g., nightly re-checks), use cron or other Linux scheduling tools.

	11.	User Interface (Web)

	•	Gradio (Python)
	•	Quick local web UI, easily accessible over LAN or localhost.
	•	FastAPI or Flask
	•	Serve a custom REST/GraphQL API or a custom front-end (React, Vue, etc.).
	•	(Removed PySide, PyQt, Tkinter, WPF/Electron references since we are now focusing on a web UI.)

	12.	Chat/Orchestration Layer

	•	Haystack (Python) for building pipeline-based search + LLM chat if desired.
	•	Or a custom pipeline in Python that wires your LLM, vector DB, and search engine together for retrieval-augmented generation.

	13.	Utilities & Common Python Dependencies

	•	Python 3.9+ (for library compatibility).
	•	PyTorch with CUDA (mandatory for GPU acceleration of YOLOv8, LLMs, etc.).
	•	transformers (HuggingFace) – for LLMs, CLIP, etc.
	•	sentence_transformers – easy usage of pre-trained embedding models.
	•	ultralytics – if installing YOLOv8 from PyPI.
	•	faiss-gpu or faiss-cpu – choose GPU if you have enough VRAM.
	•	chroma – if using Chroma DB.
	•	pytesseract or paddleocr – for OCR.
	•	watchdog – real-time file monitoring.
	•	requests, fastapi, uvicorn – if building a Python-based REST server.
	•	gradio – for out-of-the-box web-based UI.
	•	perl – for ExifTool if not using a compiled binary.
	•	Java (JRE) – for Apache Tika (only if using Tika’s server approach).

	14.	Optional Additional Tools

	•	imagededup – advanced near-duplicate detection for images.
	•	Whisper – local audio → text transcription.
	•	anytree or networkx – advanced file-relationship data structures.
	•	sqlite or another RDBMS – store additional metadata, user preferences, face IDs, etc.
	•	CUDA toolkit – ensure GPU acceleration for PyTorch, YOLOv8, etc.

General Implementation Flow for a Duplicate Checker
	1.	Exact Duplicate Check
	•	For each file, compute a hash (e.g., SHA-256).
	•	Compare against an index of known hashes to detect exact duplicates.
	2.	Near-Duplicate / Similar Files
	•	Text: Compare embeddings from sentence_transformers.
	•	Images: Use imagededup (CNN-based or perceptual hashing).
	•	Videos: Extract frames or waveforms, run embedding-based similarity if needed.

How Everything Fits Together
	1.	A Scanner/Watcher sees new or changed files → triggers the pipeline.
	2.	Each file is processed by Tika/ExifTool/FFmpeg for metadata → stored in ElasticSearch or a local DB.
	3.	If it’s an image, apply YOLOv8, CLIP embeddings, face recognition → store object tags, face tags, embedding vectors in Faiss/Chroma + references in ElasticSearch.
	4.	If it’s a document (PDF, Office), optionally run Tesseract/PaddleOCR if scanned → pass text to an LLM or sentence_transformers for classification or embedding → store those results (text + embeddings) in the vector database and ElasticSearch.
	5.	The web UI (Gradio, FastAPI + front-end, etc.) displays a dashboard with scanning progress, organizes search/filtering, and enables a chat-based or advanced query interface.
	6.	GPU acceleration is used by default for computationally heavy tasks like object detection (YOLOv8) or running LLM inferences (Mistral-7B, Phi-2, etc.).
