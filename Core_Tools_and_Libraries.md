Core Tools & Libraries
	1.	Duplicate File Checker (General)
	•	Built-in Hashing (Python’s hashlib): Compute SHA-256 or MD5 for exact duplicates.
	•	Compare checksums to quickly find identical files (even if different names).
	•	Alternatively, dupeGuru (Python/Qt) or pydupe (unofficial) for a more full-featured approach.
	•	If you want a straightforward Python library for mass deduplication, this can be integrated as well.
	2.	Media/Document Parsing & Metadata Extraction
	•	Apache Tika (Java-based)
	•	Extract text & metadata from PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, ePub, HTML, etc.
	•	ExifTool (Perl-based)
	•	Extract EXIF, IPTC, and XMP metadata from images, videos, and audio files.
	•	FFmpeg / FFprobe
	•	Parse media container metadata (duration, resolution, etc.) and extract frames or audio segments.
	•	Optional Additional Libraries: MuPDF, LibRaw, Libarchive, etc., if needed for specialized file types.
	3.	OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
	•	Tesseract (C++ engine) – Python wrapper: pytesseract
	•	Widely used and robust for printed text.
	•	PaddleOCR (Python)
	•	Lightweight detection + recognition models with good multilingual support.
	•	Either option can be swapped via a config setting.
	4.	Object Detection & Image Tagging
	•	YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
	•	For object detection in images or video frames; choose Nano/Small variants for speed.
	5.	Face Recognition
	•	InsightFace (Python)
	•	For face detection, face embedding, clustering, and recognition.
	•	Alternative face detectors: YOLO face detection or RetinaFace.
	6.	Vector Database for Embeddings
	•	Faiss (C++/Python) or Chroma (Python)
	•	Store embeddings from text, images, or faces.
	•	Supports similarity search for semantic queries, near-duplicate detection, etc.
	7.	Text Embeddings & Semantic Search
	•	Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~22M params)
	•	For fast, high-quality text embeddings.
	•	OpenCLIP (ViT-B/32 or ViT-L/14)
	•	For generating image embeddings (and text embeddings to match them).
	8.	LLMs (Summarization, Classification, Chat)
	•	Mistral-7B or Phi-2 (2.7B)
	•	Local text generation, summarization, classification.
	•	TinyLlama-1.1B
	•	Ultra-light for classification tasks or smaller GPU setups.
	•	FLAN-T5 Large
	•	Encoder–decoder model for summarizing or generating short text outputs.
	•	You’d pick one or two main LLMs depending on your GPU resources.
	•	Note: If you want a very minimal local GPU usage, smaller is better.
	9.	Search & Indexing
	•	ElasticSearch or OpenSearch
	•	Traditional text/metadata indexing and keyword-based retrieval.
	•	Pairs well with a vector database for hybrid searches (keyword + semantic).
	10.	Scheduler/Watcher

	•	watchdog (Python)
	•	Detects new/updated files in specified directories, triggers scanning/indexing.
	•	Alternatively, Windows Task Scheduler for periodic scans.

	11.	User Interface (Desktop/Web)

	•	Gradio (Python)
	•	Quick to set up local web UI, also accessible on mobile devices via LAN.
	•	PySide / PyQt / Tkinter
	•	If building a native Windows desktop app in Python.
	•	.NET / WPF or Electron
	•	If you prefer C# or JavaScript-based UIs.

	12.	Chat/Orchestration Layer

	•	Could be built with Haystack (Python) or direct custom pipeline code.
	•	Connect your LLM + vector database + search engine for retrieval-augmented generation or chat-based search.

	13.	Utilities & Common Python Dependencies

	•	Python 3.9+ or 3.10 recommended (for best library compatibility).
	•	PyTorch (with CUDA) or TensorFlow (if needed by certain models).
	•	transformers (HuggingFace) – for loading LLMs, CLIP, etc.
	•	sentence_transformers – for easy usage of pre-trained embedding models.
	•	ultralytics – if using YOLOv8 from PyPI.
	•	faiss-gpu or faiss-cpu – for vector database, depending on GPU usage.
	•	chroma – if you choose Chroma DB.
	•	pytesseract or paddleocr – whichever OCR engine.
	•	watchdog – for real-time file monitoring.
	•	requests, fastapi, uvicorn, etc. – if you want to run a small web server or REST API.
	•	gradio – for easy local web-based UI.
	•	pydupe / custom hashing logic – for general file duplication checks.
	•	perl – for ExifTool if needed.
	•	Java (JRE) – for Apache Tika if running the server-based approach.

	14.	Optional Additional Tools

	•	Imagededup – if you want advanced near-duplicate detection specifically for images.
	•	Whisper (Audio & Speech Recognition) – local speech-to-text for audio files or video soundtracks.
	•	anytree or networkx – if you want advanced file-relationship data structures.
	•	sqlite or any RDBMS – storing additional metadata, config, or user-labeled face data.
	•	GPU drivers & CUDA toolkit – to enable GPU acceleration for PyTorch and YOLOv8.

General Implementation Flow for a Duplicate Checker
	1.	Exact Duplicate Check
	•	For each file, calculate a hash (e.g. SHA-256).
	•	Compare against an index of known hashes. If it matches, it’s an exact duplicate.
	2.	Near-Duplicate or Similar Check
	•	For text files: compare embeddings from sentence_transformers.
	•	For images: run imagededup or your chosen approach (CNN-based or perceptual hashing).
	•	For videos: generate frame embeddings or waveforms if you need deep comparison.

How They Fit Together
	1.	You have a “Scanner/Watcher” that sees new or changed files → triggers the pipeline.
	2.	Each file is run through Tika/ExifTool/FFmpeg to gather metadata → stored in ElasticSearch or local DB.
	3.	If it’s an image → YOLOv8, CLIP embeddings, face recognition if relevant → store object tags, face tags, embedding vectors in Faiss/Chroma + references in ElasticSearch.
	4.	If it’s a doc (PDF, Office) → Tesseract/PaddleOCR if scanned → pass text to an LLM or sentence_transformers for classification and embeddings → store results in both your vector database and ElasticSearch.
	5.	If it’s a general file → compute a hash for duplicates → store or compare.
	6.	At query time (in chat or UI), user request is parsed by the LLM → the system retrieves relevant items from both ElasticSearch (keyword/metadata) and Faiss/Chroma (semantic similarity) → merges results → returns to user.
	7.	For reorganization or automated cleanup, the system can propose folder structures based on classification tags, highlight duplicates, etc., which the user can confirm or override.
