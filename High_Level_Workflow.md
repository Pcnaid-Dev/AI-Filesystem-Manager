High-Level Workflow (Revised for GPU & Web UI)

1. Application Configuration
	•	The user or admin defines directories (local/remote) to monitor, file types to index, scheduling rules, and which AI models to use (OCR, face recognition, etc.).
	•	Note: All AI pipelines (object detection, LLM inferences) should be configured to leverage GPU acceleration via CUDA.

2. Scanner/Watcher Initiation
	•	A monitor (e.g., Python’s watchdog or a scheduled job) observes specified folders for new, updated, or deleted files.
	•	On detecting a change, the system sends the file to the indexing/analysis pipeline.

3. Indexing/Analysis Pipeline
	1.	Basic Metadata Extraction
	•	Tools like ExifTool, FFprobe, Apache Tika gather file properties (size, format, EXIF, doc metadata).
	2.	Duplicate Check (General + Media)
	•	Compute file checksums (SHA-256 or MD5) for exact duplicates.
	•	If it’s an image, optionally use imagededup or a perceptual hashing approach for near-duplicate detection.
	3.	File-Type-Specific Processing
	•	Documents (PDF, Word, etc.)
	•	OCR with Tesseract or PaddleOCR if scanned.
	•	Use a GPU-accelerated LLM or sentence_transformers to generate embeddings, classify, or summarize.
	•	Images
	•	YOLOv8 (running on GPU) for object detection.
	•	InsightFace (GPU-accelerated) for face detection/recognition.
	•	CLIP embeddings for scene or general content tagging.
	•	Audio/Video
	•	Extract metadata with FFprobe.
	•	Optional speech-to-text with Whisper (GPU-friendly for faster transcription).
	•	YOLOv8 or CLIP on key frames for video object/scene detection.
	4.	Content & Embedding Storage
	•	Save text-based metadata to ElasticSearch for keyword searches.
	•	Generate embeddings (MiniLM, CLIP, or face embeddings) on GPU, and store them in a vector database (Faiss/Chroma).
	•	Apply or refine tags (e.g., recognized objects, people, events).

4. Tagging & Classification Updates
	•	Assign or update tags based on the pipeline results (e.g., face IDs, “cat,” “outdoor,” “invoice,” “year=2021,” etc.).
	•	If duplicates are found, mark them and optionally prompt for next steps (keep, merge, delete).

5. User Interface (Web UI)
	•	Dashboard: Displays system status, new files, duplicates, recommended reorganizations.
	•	Explorer: Filter by file type, date, recognized faces, or AI-generated tags.
	•	Search Panel: Combines ElasticSearch queries (keyword) with vector similarity (semantic search).
	•	Chat UI: Natural language queries like “Find photos of John’s birthday 2022” or “Summarize this PDF.” The LLM orchestrates queries to the index and returns results.

6. Scheduling & Automation
	•	Automatically re-scan or re-check at intervals, or run continuous watch.
	•	On certain triggers, propose reorganizations (“Move old documents to Archive,” “Remove duplicates”).

7. Knowledge Base Integration
	•	System can create/edit KB entries based on discovered data (e.g., “Tax forms found; add to KB?”).
	•	The user can refine or confirm these entries in the web UI/chat.

8. Notifications & Mobile/Web Companion
	•	The main app can push notifications when scans complete or duplicates are found.
	•	A lightweight web or mobile-friendly interface (via the same web UI) can display status and accept quick actions (approve reorganization, rename face tags).

9. Ongoing Maintenance & Optimization
	•	Clean up indexes, remove stale entries.
	•	Retrain or swap out AI models if needed.
	•	Perform performance tuning (e.g., concurrency limits, batch processing, GPU usage settings).
