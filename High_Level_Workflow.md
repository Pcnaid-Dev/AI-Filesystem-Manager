High-Level Workflow
	1.	Application Configuration
	•	The user or admin defines the directories (local and/or remote) to monitor, file types to index, scheduling rules, and which AI models to use (OCR, face recognition, etc.).
	2.	Scanner/Watcher Initiation
	•	A monitor (e.g., Python’s watchdog or a scheduled task) observes specified folders for new, updated, or deleted files.
	•	On detecting a file event, the system sends the file to the Indexing/Analysis Pipeline.
	3.	Indexing/Analysis Pipeline
	•	Basic Metadata Extraction
	•	Tools like ExifTool, FFprobe, Apache Tika gather file properties (size, format, EXIF, doc metadata).
	•	Duplicate Check (General + Media)
	•	Compute file checksums (SHA-256 or MD5) to identify exact duplicates.
	•	Optionally, if it’s an image, also check near-duplicates (e.g., imagededup or perceptual hashing).
	•	File-Type-Specific Processing
	•	Documents (PDF, Word, etc.):
	•	OCR using Tesseract or PaddleOCR if it’s scanned.
	•	Use an LLM or sentence_transformers to generate embeddings, classify or summarize.
	•	Images:
	•	YOLOv8 for object detection.
	•	InsightFace for face detection/recognition.
	•	CLIP embeddings for scene or general content tagging.
	•	Audio/Video:
	•	Extract metadata with FFprobe.
	•	Optional speech-to-text (Whisper) for audio tracks.
	•	YOLOv8 or CLIP on key frames for video object/scene detection.
	•	Content & Embedding Storage
	•	Save text-based metadata to ElasticSearch for keyword searches.
	•	Generate embeddings (MiniLM, CLIP, or face embeddings) and store them in a vector database (Faiss/Chroma).
	•	Apply or refine tags (e.g., recognized objects, people, events).
	4.	Tagging & Classification Updates
	•	Assign or update tags based on AI results (e.g., face IDs, “cat,” “outdoor,” “invoice,” “year=2021,” etc.).
	•	If duplicates are found, mark them in the system and optionally prompt the user for next steps (e.g., keep one, merge, delete).
	5.	User Interface (Desktop/Web/Chat)
	•	Dashboard: Displays system status, new files, duplicates, recommended reorganizations.
	•	Explorer: Allows browsing by file type, date, tags, recognized faces.
	•	Search Panel: Combines ElasticSearch queries (keyword) with vector similarity searches (semantic).
	•	Chat UI: Natural language queries like “Find photos of John’s birthday 2022” or “Summarize this PDF.” The LLM orchestrates a query to the indexes and returns results or an action plan.
	6.	Scheduling & Automation
	•	Automatically re-scan or re-check at intervals, or run continuous watch.
	•	On certain triggers, propose reorganizations (e.g., “Move old documents to Archive folder,” “Remove 5 duplicates found in Documents folder”).
	7.	Knowledge Base Integration
	•	System can create/edit knowledge base entries based on discovered data (e.g., “Tax forms found in the Taxes directory; added instructions for future references.”).
	•	The user can refine or confirm these entries in the chat/UI.
	8.	Notifications & Mobile/Web Companion
	•	The main app can push notifications when scans complete or duplicates are found.
	•	A lightweight companion (Gradio or mobile UI) can display status and accept quick actions (approve reorganization, rename face tags).
	9.	Ongoing Maintenance & Optimization
	•	Clean up indexes, remove stale entries.
	•	Optionally retrain or swap out AI models.
	•	Perform performance tuning (e.g., limit concurrency, batch processing, GPU usage settings).
