Comprehensive Instructions for Building an AI-Powered File Organizer

Objectives:
	1.	Runs in the background (daemon-like) under a Linux environment (WSL2, but no WSL2 setup details needed).
	2.	Uses NVIDIA GPU for accelerating AI tasks (object detection, LLM inferences).
	3.	Exposes a web-based UI (dashboard, search, chat) instead of a desktop GUI.
	4.	Provides file organization, indexing, duplicate detection, and advanced AI-driven search (including face recognition, object tagging, OCR, and summarization).

⸻

1. Core Functionality
	1.	Directory Monitoring & Scanning
	•	A watcher process or scheduled tasks that detect new/modified files in specified directories.
	•	Triggers indexing pipeline whenever changes occur.
	2.	Metadata Extraction & Indexing
	•	Uses tools like Apache Tika for document metadata/text, ExifTool for image/video EXIF, FFmpeg/FFprobe for media details.
	•	OCR with Tesseract or PaddleOCR (for scanned documents).
	•	Writes results (title, author, EXIF, etc.) to a text-based search index (e.g., ElasticSearch or OpenSearch).
	3.	Duplicate Detection
	•	Exact duplicates: compare file hashes (SHA-256 or MD5).
	•	Near-duplicate (images): use imagededup or a perceptual hashing method for images.
	4.	Semantic Embeddings & Fuzzy Search
	•	Generate text embeddings (Sentence Transformers or LLMs) for documents.
	•	Generate image embeddings (OpenCLIP) or object detection results (YOLOv8).
	•	Store these embeddings in a vector database (Faiss or Chroma) for similarity queries.
	5.	Tagging & Classification
	•	LLM-based classification or summarization for text documents.
	•	YOLOv8 for object detection in images/videos; InsightFace for face detection & recognition.
	•	Apply auto-tags (e.g., “cat,” “office,” “John’s face,” “invoice”), store them in the search index.
	6.	User Interface (Web-based)
	•	A background service with a web server (FastAPI/Flask/Gradio).
	•	A dashboard showing file indexing progress, duplicates, recommended reorganizations.
	•	An explorer with filters (tags, dates, file types).
	•	A chat or advanced query panel for natural language queries (“Find pictures of John from 2021,” “Summarize the ‘ProjectProposal.pdf’”).
	7.	Automation & Scheduling
	•	If new files arrive, the system auto-classifies, extracts metadata, checks duplicates, and indexes.
	•	Optional background or scheduled triggers for large re-scans.
	8.	Knowledge Base
	•	Store user instructions or notes.
	•	The system suggests new entries based on discovered data (e.g., “Found a tax form, want to note it?”).

2. Advanced & Optional Features
	1.	Face Recognition & Object Tagging in Video
	•	Split video into frames with FFmpeg, run YOLOv8 or CLIP for scene/object detection, InsightFace for face identification.
	•	Store recognized faces/objects as tags.
	2.	Cloud/Network Drive Support
	•	Index remote directories (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive).
	•	Use incremental or partial caching for offline operation.
	3.	Lightweight Web Companion
	•	A minimal UI accessible via any browser on the local network.
	•	Real-time status updates or push notifications upon completing scans or reorganizations.
	4.	Context-Aware File Optimization
	•	Propose cleanups for duplicates, large or old files.
	•	Provide usage statistics to help decide on archiving or reorganizing.

4. Implementation Phases
	1.	Phase 1: Basic Metadata Extraction & Indexing
	•	Establish directory list and scanning approach (watchdog or scheduled).
	•	Integrate Tika, ExifTool, store results in ElasticSearch.
	•	Minimal web server to confirm data is being indexed.
	2.	Phase 2: Classification & Tagging
	•	LLM-based doc classification, YOLOv8 for image detection.
	•	Face detection with InsightFace.
	•	Use near-duplicate detection (imagededup).
	3.	Phase 3: Semantic Search & Summarization
	•	Vector embeddings (Sentence Transformers, CLIP, or LLM).
	•	Store in Faiss/Chroma for semantic/fuzzy queries.
	•	Summarize docs with chosen LLM (Mistral, Phi-2, etc.).
	4.	Phase 4: Automation & Scheduling
	•	Full file watcher integration or cron-based scheduling.
	•	Automatic tagging rules for new files, local caching.
	5.	Phase 5: Web UI & Knowledge Base

5. Final Build Notes
	•	The entire system runs in the background within Linux (WSL2).
	•	The user accesses it via a web browser on the same machine or LAN (via localhost or IP).
	•	All AI tasks (detection, embeddings, LLM inferences) are GPU-accelerated using CUDA.
	•	The pipeline is modular, so each step (OCR, face recognition, doc summarization) can be easily swapped or upgraded.
