AI-Powered Automated File System Organizer, Indexer and Search Tool

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
	•	File System Organization & Sorting
	•	imagededup (Python) for identifying duplicate or near-duplicate images.
	•	Combining Tika and ExifTool to extract file details (doc properties, EXIF).
	•	Use TinyLlama (1B) or Phi-2 (2.7B) for quick text-based classification of documents when needed (e.g., deciding if something is a “contract,” “invoice,” or “presentation”).
	•	Indexing & Analysis
	•	Apache Tika + PaddleOCR or Tesseract for text extraction from PDFs/scanned docs.
	•	OpenCLIP or CLIP-based pipeline for basic visual embeddings to identify image/video content tags.
	•	Store embeddings and tags (face, object, scene) in Faiss or Chroma for real-time vector lookup.
	•	Search & Retrieval
	•	ElasticSearch for keyword + metadata indexing, combined with a Sentence Transformers model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic text search.
	•	For advanced queries (vector-based), connect ElasticSearch with Chroma or Faiss to blend textual and vector similarity.
	•	Scheduling & Automation
	•	Use a Python-based scheduler or Windows Task Scheduler to periodically call the indexing pipeline.
	•	If real-time triggers are needed, integrate the watchdog library (Python) for folder monitoring.
	•	Knowledge Base & Chat Integration
	•	For local inference chat or brainstorming, run a small but effective LLM like Mistral-7B or Phi-2.
	•	The chat UI can be built using Gradio or a minimal .NET/WPF UI, with a behind-the-scenes pipeline orchestrating queries against your vector + ElasticSearch indexes.

2. ADVANCED CAPABILITIES
	•	Metadata & Tag Intelligence
	•	When new documents or media are scanned, automatically apply classification rules using the combination of Tika metadata, file path, and an LLM classification call for auto-tagging.
	•	For refined tagging, run image embeddings from OpenCLIP or object detection from YOLOv8.
	•	Image & Video Analysis
	•	YOLOv8 (Nano/Small for speed) for object detection, scene detection, activity tagging.
	•	InsightFace for face detection and recognition to cluster or identify known individuals.
	•	For advanced video analysis, break down frames with FFmpeg and run them through YOLOv8 or CLIP embeddings for scene-level tagging.
	•	Context-Aware File Optimization
	•	Inspect file usage frequency (last accessed date), size, duplicates, etc., for suggestions.
	•	Provide automated “clean-up” or reorganization proposals in the chat UI.
	•	Multi-Format Support
	•	Integrate additional open-source converters/libraries (mupdf, libraw, etc.) for deeper metadata extraction, then feed the text/images into the relevant AI pipelines.
	•	Pluggable AI Models / ML Pipelines
	•	Maintain a modular “model registry” approach in your code, allowing you to easily swap OCR (Tesseract/PaddleOCR), face recognition (InsightFace), or summarization (TinyLlama, Mistral).
	•	This ensures minimal code changes when upgrading a model or toggling between CPU/GPU usage.

3. NEWLY ADDED FEATURES
	1.	Lightweight Mobile or Web Companion
	•	Run a Gradio or minimal Flask/FastAPI server for the main Windows app to serve a web UI.
	•	The companion interface can display quick search results, file previews, or summary updates, and you can push notifications using local webhooks or a messaging queue for scan completions.
	2.	Cloud/Network Drive Support
	•	Maintain the same indexing pipeline, but point your “Scanner/Watcher” to remote shares or cloud-synced folders (OneDrive, Google Drive).
	•	Use incremental indexing with local caches in Chroma or ElasticSearch so you only re-scan changed files.
	3.	Facial Recognition & Object Tagging
	•	Add a pipeline stage for face detection (InsightFace’s RetinaFace or YOLOv8 face) followed by face embeddings for recognition.
	•	YOLOv8 for object tagging; store recognized objects (e.g. “cat,” “car,” “desk”) in the file’s metadata.
	•	Provide a UI panel for manual overrides or user-labeled face names.

4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (HIGHLIGHTS)
	•	Scanner/Watcher
	•	Python’s watchdog for real-time detection or Windows scheduled tasks for batch scans.
	•	Indexer & Classification Engine
	•	A pipeline that calls Tika + OCR for text extraction, CLIP/YOLOv8 for visual embeddings/labels, Face recognition if applicable.
	•	Writes results (tags, embeddings, metadata) into both ElasticSearch (for text/keyword search) and Chroma or Faiss (for vector-based semantic or image similarity search).
	•	Search Engine
	•	Traditional indexing: use “document type,” “filename,” and “extracted text.”
	•	Vector-based: “semantic embeddings,” “image embeddings,” or “face embeddings” in a vector store.
	•	Combine the results for fuzzy/semantic queries, e.g. “pictures from John’s birthday 2022.”
	•	Chat/Orchestration Layer
	•	Use an LLM (Mistral-7B or Phi-2) for natural language queries. It can parse the user’s question and retrieve from your combined indexes.
	•	Return answers, found files, or recommended reorganization steps in a user-friendly chat or console UI.
	•	AI/ML Integration
	•	Provide a simple config file or UI to specify which OCR, summarizer, or face model to use.
	•	This “pluggability” ensures minimal refactoring if you want to switch from Tesseract to PaddleOCR or upgrade your face recognition model.
	•	User Interface
	•	Desktop GUI in .NET (C#/WPF) or Python (QT/PySide) that displays a dashboard, file explorer, and chat panel.
	•	A minimal Gradio or web-based companion can provide remote or mobile access.
